 # Recap
 After a long and hopefully restful break, we'll take a class to look back on what you've learned so far, before digging in and learning new concepts.
 
 Take today's class to add notes to your sketchbook and complete the exercises on the following pages.
 
 Remember that your sketchbook can be brought into your final exam and referred to while explaining your ISP later this year.
